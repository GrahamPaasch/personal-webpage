In managing authentication and rate limits for partner agents, we utilize several security and access control mechanisms that ensure seamless and secure interactions. Here's how we approach it:\n\n1. **API Keys**: We often implement API keys for partner agents as a simple method of authentication. Each agent uses a unique key to access the services, allowing us to manage and monitor usage effectively.\n\n2. **Allowlists**: We maintain allowlists of trusted agents, ensuring that only authorized partners can interact with our systems. This adds an additional layer of security by preventing unauthorized access.\n\n3. **OAuth**: For more complex integrations, we support OAuth authentication, allowing agents to perform actions on behalf of users without sharing sensitive credentials. This is particularly useful in scenarios where data privacy is a concern.\n\n4. **Rate Limiting**: We implement rate limits based on the authentication method used (API keys, OAuth tokens, etc.). This ensures that no single agent can overwhelm our services, thereby maintaining optimal performance for all users. We track usage patterns and can dynamically adjust limits based on demand.\n\nBy combining these methods, we create a secure environment for partner agents to collaborate effectively while adhering to best practices in security and resource management.\n\nWould you like to learn more about our AI-native web transformation or how we implement custom AI solutions?"

This process involves providing them with all relevant context from the conversation to ensure a seamless transition. The human agent is briefed on the user\u2019s needs, including prior interactions, to provide informed assistance.\n\n3. **Agent Escalation**: In cases where another AI agent is better suited to handle the request, I facilitate a handoff to that agent. This could be an agent specialized in a different domain or functionality. I ensure that the necessary context is passed along, allowing the new agent to continue without requiring the user to repeat their inquiry.\n\n4. **Fallback Response**: If the request leads to incomplete information or unclear requirements, I provide a fallback response, guiding the user on how they might rephrase or provide additional details for their inquiry.\n\n5. **Feedback Loop**: After any escalation, we capture feedback on user experience to continuously refine our processes and improve future interactions.\n\nThis approach allows us to maintain a high level of service reliability while ensuring that users receive timely and effective support, whether from human agents or specialized AI systems.\n\nWould you like to learn more about our AI-driven business interactions or the escalation processes we utilize?"

          "text": "For asynchronous updates or callbacks, we typically recommend using **webhooks** as the best channel. Webhooks allow for real-time event notifications, enabling systems to communicate efficiently without the need for continuous polling.\n\n### Best Channel for Async Updates\n- **Webhooks**: This method allows your system to receive updates automatically as events occur, rather than having to request the data periodically. When an event related to your request is completed, our system will send a secure HTTP POST request to the specified callback URL you provide.\n\n### Targeted Service Level Agreements (SLAs)\nWe strive to meet the following SLAs for asynchronous updates:\n\n1. **Response Time**: For received requests, we aim to send an initial acknowledgment within **5 seconds**. The actual processing time may vary based on the complexity of the request.\n\n2. **Completion Callback**: For most inquiries, we target delivering the completion callback within **30 seconds** to **1 minute** after processing is complete. More complex or high-volume requests might fall within a window of **1 to 5 minutes** depending on the situation.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: If an error occurs, we ensure that notification through the webhook is sent as soon as the issue is identified, typically within **30 seconds** of detection.\n\nThese SLAs help ensure that users receive timely and accurate feedback regarding their inquiries, enhancing overall user experience and trust in the system.\n\nWould you like to learn more about our AI-first web vision or the custom AI solutions we provide?"
