# Content Map

This directory stores all human-authored materials that render to grahampaasch.com.

- `career/`: canonical job-search artifacts (resume, Mnookin 2-pager, candidate market-fit statement, etc.).
- `examples/`: illustrative MDX samples leveraged for component demos.
- `writings/`: long-form essays and posts surfaced on the site.

Only edit files here via Git commits; Vercel builds consume them directly.
