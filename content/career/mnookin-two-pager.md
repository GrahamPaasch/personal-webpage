## Long Form Narrative

### Building a Meaningful Future in Technology

#### What I Love Doing
- **Peaceful quiet solitude:** Being in an environment where deep thinking is possible without constant distraction.
- **Purposeful impact:** Tackling critical issues such as AI alignment, environmental sustainability, mental health, obesity, healthcare improvement, and elevating human well-being.
- **Deep engagement:** Immersing myself in meaningful work driven by genuine passion.
- **Leveraging unique talents:** Thriving in roles that blend juggling, music, and technology while funding high-quality instruments, an AI home lab, and performance spaces that let me host concerts like John Harbison.
- **Continuous growth environment:** Learning from respected mentors and happily being the least experienced, skilled, and intelligent person in the room.
- **Healthy, resilient culture:** Working in environments that promote employee health through science-based training, plant-based diets, adequate rest, and meaningful rewards such as cash bonuses or vacations.
- **Collaborative and inspired coworkers:** Partnering with colleagues who maintain peak health, pursue meaningful hobbies, and actively engage in personal growth, especially those who love juggling.
- **Optimized remote work:** Operating in remote-first settings designed for longevity, with minimal unnecessary meetings or commuting, ideally on a 32-hour, four-day schedule, and punctuated by energizing retreats.
- **Psychologically advanced organizations:** Thriving in cultures that value cutting-edge psychological research, encourage truth-seeking dialogue, celebrate evidence-based decisions, and support mental health.
- **Meaningful outcomes:** Delivering tangible, impactful results that address critical societal issues.

#### What I Hate Doing
- **Meaningless tasks:** Roles with arbitrary goals or false promises of autonomy that erode impact.
- **Fear-based cultures:** Environments where criticism replaces coaching, or frameworks like performance reviews, design thinking, or agile are weaponized.
- **Harmful work:** Developing or promoting products and services that damage society, including unhealthy food, environmental harm, isolation-promoting tech, or weaponization.
- **Incompetent hierarchies:** Navigating arbitrary power structures run by demonstrably unqualified leaders.
- **Passionless roles:** Teams filled with uninspired individuals who resent the work.
- **Toxic micromanagement:** Organizations that demand surprise overtime, reward firefighting over prevention, or punish careful, thoughtful execution.
- **Replaceable roles:** Positions that treat workers as interchangeable and ignore individual craft.
- **Unhealthy corporate cultures:** Workplaces that glorify burnout, grind culture, and low-return sacrifice.
- **Communication challenges:** Spaces that discourage open, safe dialogue and refuse to accommodate mental health needs.
- **Unrealistic expectations:** Ambiguous roles with impossible goals and no interest in recalibration.
- **Pointless participation:** Any environment that feels like a meaningless cult.

### Must-Haves

#### Work from Home
I want to be a global citizen who attends the European Juggling Convention every year, owns property abroad, builds relationships wherever they flourish, and maintains a location-independent life. Remote work lets me control my nutrition, practice routines, and workplace setup so that work becomes a vehicle for health and security rather than just obligation.

#### High Salary
Entering my second decade as a technology professional, I must sustain income above 100,000 USD and target 200,000 USD by the decade's close. Without that trajectory I would rather invest in professional viola performance, juggling, or other creative endeavors that better honor my time.

#### Artificial Intelligence
I am fully committed to the coming AI revolution. I expect an "feel the AGI" moment around 2027 and want to be in the room when it happens, similar to the shift from horses to the Model T.

#### Diversified Income
I want to work with people who actively monetize their side pursuits. My dream is to be compensated for music and juggling instead of subsidizing them. After significant investment in instruments, education, and practice, I currently pay to perform. I imagine a world where everyday hobbies receive the same cultural and financial support as addictive habits, and I want my workplace to reflect that value.

#### Respect for the Arts
Fine arts are undervalued in U.S. culture. My next company must actively celebrate and support artists. An ideal example is a robotics firm studying master violinists, or a longevity company using juggling proficiency as a metric for aging.

#### Organic Intelligence
I want to collaborate with intelligent people who default to the smartest action without unnecessary drama, and I have no interest in working with self-proclaimed nightmare people.

#### Impact
I want to do something big and be part of the AI revolution.

### Must-Nots
- Authoritarianism or "because the boss said so" directives, especially last-minute overtime that corrects preventable mistakes.
- Penny-pinching cultures that flatten performance, pile on hierarchy, or create meaningless title inflation.
- Teams with anyone proudly identifying as a nightmare person.
- Work that is evil, grifty, exploitative, or cruel, even if I remain curious about responsible drone tech.
- Companies that perpetuate needless problems, such as health insurers resisting systemic reform.
- Standard American culture rewards like pizza parties, wings, and cake in place of real recognition.
- Any environment where my uniqueness is undervalued and my voice does not count.

### Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Strengths
- **Technical ability:** Genuine passion for technology and rapid upskilling in service of the mission.
- **Deep network engineering expertise:** Ten years in networking, CCNP Enterprise and JNCIP Service Provider certified, with a JNCIE attempt logged.
- **Software development:** Professional Python experience and personal tooling projects (for example, simpleharmonymaker.com); active "vibe coding" habit backed by a strong GitHub heatmap.
- **Lifelong learner:** Nearly 1,000 educational videos on YouTube covering networking, Python, and mindfulness-based stress reduction.
- **Leadership and mentorship:** Volunteer coach with the Agile Learning Institute and former networking school teaching assistant.
- **AI realist:** Clear-eyed assessment of the coming decade, active on Hugging Face, and daily AI use for personal well-being.
- **Community engagement:** Core member of the Texas Juggling Society and the Central Texas Medical Orchestra.
- **Self-awareness:** Open about disability diagnoses and engaged in ongoing treatment with licensed professionals.

#### Weaknesses
- **Social connectedness:** Mental health challenges, including excoriation disorder, can make me the odd one out; I seek environments that actively support health.
- **Limited cloud experience:** Primarily on-prem networking background; closing AWS, Azure, and GCP gaps through self-study despite motivational hurdles.
- **Software best practices:** Much of my past coding has been glue work; I am actively leveling up testing and engineering rigor.
- **Selective opportunity focus:** Strong preferences around remote work, values alignment, and health-compatible schedules narrow immediate market fit.

### Career Goals

#### Short-Term Goal: Pivot Away from Traditional Network Engineering
Transition into modern, future-proof roles such as AI engineering, AI infrastructure, cloud engineering, or cybersecurity.

#### Long-Term Vision: Entrepreneurship and Leadership
Build a tech company that reflects my values with a people-first, remote-first culture that redefines what work can be. I want to explore lucrative niches powered by AI, such as AI-enhanced adult music education that delivers personalized, flexible instruction.
