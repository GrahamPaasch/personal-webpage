## Statement

Defensive cybersecurity and network automation engineer focused on keeping critical infrastructure online under pressure. I build EVPN-VXLAN fabrics, NGFW/IPS guardrails, and IaC pipelines that satisfy Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) while delivering repeatable pre-flight validation. My recent work blends PyATS, pfSense, HAProxy, GNS3, and Guacamole into containerized training ranges so operators can rehearse before a live cutover.

I am targeting remote-first teams working on defensive cyber operations, contested-spectrum communications, and the resilient technologies being proven on the ground in Ukraine. My ideal role combines hands-on Python/Ansible automation, SIEM/SOAR integrations, and red-to-blue lab environments where lessons learned become source-controlled documentation.

Bring me in when you need someone who treats infrastructure as code, writes the lab manuals, and hardens the network so your mission survives the next incident. Let's talk if that is the kind of defensive posture you want to scale.
