Bryan Johnson is Right About Everything

The man, the myth, the legend: the big BJ Bryan Johnson. He is an ex-Mormon who
sold Braintree to Venmo, made around $800 million from the sale, then
decided the number one priority in his life was to become the
healthiest man in the world. He created a social media company named
Blueprint to document his journey in this endeavor. In many corners of 
the internet, for his efforts he became the target of hate. People hate
hate hate this man. Here's my journey along this emotional rollercoaster:

Timeline

2022 ish ?
Initial discovery. Total fascination with the lengths he was going to
meet his goals. He had a live in doctor. A clinic in his humble abode
(a multi-million dollar mansion in LA). Every piece of health machinery
you could imagine, in a private collection. Highly trained and specialized
staff doing expensive house calls day in and day out. He seemed to be taking
a sort of "functional health" approach to improving his health, taking every
single possible sort of health test, recommended or not and basing future
actions on the results. He called his strategy Blueprint, a cyclical system 
of measurement -> evidence -> and protocol looped and repeated until calibrated
to optimal outcomes. He seemed to be aware of the flaws of basing health
protocols on "N of 1" evidence. He insisted that his approaches were completely
based on the science and best evidence available today. He made it a point to
say that his diet came from high quality population based studies. He eats
a 100% plant based whole food diet and claims to be vegan, despite consuming
non-vegan supplements. His strategy centered around supplements. He took
over 100 pills of various supplements in a single day, and seemed to present this
as some sort of point of pride in his approach. I was sold. I wanted to live my
life like this. I too, wanted to be one of the healthiest men in the world.

2022 - 2023
Hate. It's super easy to dunk on this man. Live in doctors? A multi-million dollar 
mansion in LA? Supplement industry shill? Function health scammer? Zero f's to give
for anything in life besides himself and his goals (why not fund scientific trails
rather than getting zapped all day with experimental lasers)? I found myself on
Instagram, leaving comment after comment, calling this man out for being so full
of himself, and telling people "you can too!" while he shares the results of his
latest $100,000+ machine in his modest LA mansion. It was disgusting. It still is
disgusting. It's a reality check. These are the feudal days. The age of the scam.
Absolutely, you can too! But the bill is due. It was a point of pride that he was
spending millions of dollars per year on his health. It was part of the company
brand. He claimed that other wealthy elite were reaching out to him and trying to
get started with the Blueprint Protocols. The holy grail of health. Have we entered the age were being rich means
you live to your 300s, doing cartwheels and backflips when you're 299, 
while people born into the wrong zip code or that had even the slightest challenge
in life die from obesity and heart disease before they make it to 60, living a
life trapped inside the 50% or more of their body that is made entirely out of fat,
to the point where their internal organs like their heart and lungs are wearing
visceral fat like a heavy subzero winter coat? If only you had $1 billion you could
walk up that flight of stairs without wheezing. Affordable and universal public health
with top tier outcomes? What's that? Never mind, here's $20,000 I found in my couch.
Now rub that cream in there. Nice and thick. Go on.

Joining the cult. So, the thing is with Bryan Johnson, I really like the man. He claims
to be vegan. Even though that claim is problematic in its truth, this checks off a giant
respect box on my checklist. He's a legit tech God. Braintree is a systems engineering
sort of information technology company that snaps together the physical widgets and 
mind twisting text that makes payments go vroom on the internet. If you've ever made a
payment, especially using Venmo, and you liked the experience, you got a little bit of
big BJ in your pocket in which to say thanks. As a bit of a tech person myself, this makes
him into somebody for me to look up to and admire. Wouldn't I want such a success? At the
end of the day, how can I hate this man for being the person who succeeded where I failed? If
I made Braintree and sold it to Venmo, would I hate myself? Also, who can really fault someone for
wanting to be the worlds healthiest person? We all just went through a damn pandemic. Obesity
and heart disease are becoming world-wide pandemics of their own. Ultimately, his vision is
to make a system that anyone can follow to achieve the same results that he did. What could
possibly be so wrong about that?

The beginning of the BJ sales era. It started off as jokes. Buy my snake oil. It was printed
on the bottle. Then came the supplements, the powders, the merch, the subscription fees, the
tests. Buy, buy, buy. If only you pay thousands of your pathetic measly earnings to a near
billionaire, someday "you can too!" But only if you're "cut out for it". If you've "got what
it takes". Translation: whatever happens is your fault, not mine. If none of my claims come true,
it not because my claims were untrue, it's because you failed me, you failed yourself, you are
a disgusting person who is not capable nor deserving of my magic dust. It only works on the
right kinds of people, and you ain't it. This seems to be a common theme in today's age of the scam. 
If only you "work on yourself" and have "grit and determination" you too someday could achieve the
same kind of success as the billionaire to which you just gave your last dollar. The reason that pill
you popped didn't work is because you just don't have what it takes. Your discipline is trash. It has
nothing to do with the pill being at best a sugar pill laced with toxic heavy metals. It's okay though,
buy my course on self mastery and discipline. Typically $10,000, but since I know you tried already
with the supplements, how's $8,000? Good? Good. Oh, what? You didn't even finish the course? Sorry,
can't help you. It must be your genetics. But probably not because Goggins has bad genetics as well.
It's just you. Meanwhile, if you go to a reputable place for medical care, you might be diagnosed
with adult ADHD. A wonderful thing to happen. You can get care. You take real medications that passed
real scientific trials, and you can solve the problem of "doing what you know". But forget about that,
there's no snazzy logo on a dram from the pharmacy. Also, big pharma, ahhhhh!

More to come! Sorry, I need to stop writing. I've been writing this morning for well over an hour. I need
to take a break. I hope to come back and finish this story. The title thus far may seem like sarcasm or a mistake.
It is not.
