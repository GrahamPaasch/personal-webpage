# I Don't Like the Food in Texas

When I was in Wisconsin, I ate two things that reminded me of what I like about food:

1. Door County Apples
2. Door County Cherry Pie

Those two things don't exist in Texas, which instead has:

1. BBQ (pure meat)
2. Tacos (pure meat inside a tortilla)

In Wisconsin, the best things were "fruit". In Texas, it's going to be "meat", typically red meat. Even the cherry pie was mostly just specialized tart cherries that only grow in Door County. 

When you hear, eat more fruits and vegetables, what does that mean? To many, it means go to the grocery
store, grab whatever bag of apples they happen to carry, and eat them. To me, there's more to the story.

My two favorite kinds of squash are Carnival and Kabocha. I was lucky to have some Kabocha the other week
becuase it bought it in my groceries. Now? Gone. A seasonal food literially sometimes means that it is
only available for a week or two in a year.

To me, that's special. You can slaughter a cow at any time. But the cherry and apple season in Wisconsin
is brief. Sure, you can get an "apple" anytime you want. McDonalds sells "apple" slices. But a Cortland
plucked from the tree? A honeycrisp the size of a grapefruit? Forget it. These things are available in
one small time window during the year, in one small plot of dirt on Earth. You'll go your entire life
without having anything even close.
