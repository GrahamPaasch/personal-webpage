These values and constraints guide how I work and what I avoid.

## Values

- Evidence-based, health-positive, and respectful collaboration
- High-signal communication; minimal meetings
- Continuous learning and mentorship

## Constraints

- Limited synchronous availability; prefer async where possible
- Prefer clear agendas and documented outcomes

## Red Lines

- No grifting, exploitation, or harmful use-cases
- No handling or storing of sensitive PII beyond necessity
- No authoritarian or fear-based cultures

## Collaboration Style

- Direct, concise, with receipts (citations) where relevant
- Prefer measurable outcomes over vague claims
