"to the victims of fascism and the war"

How does it feel it have people come after you? And not
with good intentions? Just listen to the music. It will 
tell you. 

"Shostakovich lived in fear, sleeping in the stairwell outside his apartment to spare his family the experience of his imminent arrest."

That knock on the door. They're here. How would you feel?
Would you even hear it? If you did, would you try to ignore it?

How could you experience hope in such a situation, any way
any how? Shostakovich does. It's right there, in the cello
solo section. For one single measure. This is the only moment
of this entire work with hope. It's lasts for one measure in
one chord change in measure 148. And then it's gone. 

Back to the knocking on the door. They're here. But the fear
is gone. The sudden jolt is met by complete indifference. The 
pizz in measure 169 is every bit as fearce and threating as the
chords prior, but they're weak. Barely audible even. They don't
register anymore. Whatever happens, happens.

The knocking gets louder, but the indifference stays. Do what
they will. There nothing left to be afraid for. The only thing
that remains is a pure and chronic sadness. With no ability to
become any sadder. 

The next movement makes it very clear... the DSCH motif, followed by mordeno. Literially, it says "Shostakovich
slowly die away", right there in the music.

He was stockpilling pills for his attempt. Then he wrote
this piece in 3 days. Invited his favorite string quartet
over to play it for it, and simply wept into his hands 
afterwards. No words.

"The Borodin Quartet played this work to the composer at his Moscow home, hoping for his criticisms. But Shostakovich, overwhelmed by this beautiful realisation of his most personal feelings, buried his head in his hands and wept. When they had finished playing, the four musicians quietly packed up their instruments and stole out of the room."

Afterwards, they called his closest friend, who came over, and
ended his attempt at ending his life. 

This piece saved his life. The hope he expressed in one chord
of one measure came to light, someway somehow. All this happens
in movement 4, Largo. The greatest movement of the greatest
piece of music ever written, by the greatest composer ever.
